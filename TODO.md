# Chess Learning Tree - Launch Plan

## Goal: Get Users In, Collect Feedback by Friday

**Priority: Real users testing the app > Monetization**

---

## TOMORROW MORNING - Talk About User Feedback Strategy

### Questions to Discuss:
1. **Who are your first testers?** (Friends, chess Discord, Reddit?)
2. **How will you collect feedback?** (Form, DMs, in-app?)
3. **What do you most want to learn?** (Onboarding friction? Puzzle difficulty? UI confusion?)
4. **How many testers do you want by Friday?** (5? 20? 50?)

## TOMORROW (Day 1) - Deploy & Open Access

### Morning: Get Site Live
- [ ] Deploy to Vercel (connect GitHub repo)
- [ ] Configure any needed env vars
- [ ] Test all pages work on production
- [ ] Get shareable URL ready

### Afternoon: Remove All Barriers
- [ ] Make ALL lessons accessible (no gating)
- [ ] Ensure progress saves work for everyone
- [ ] Test the full user flow start-to-finish
- [ ] Fix any obvious bugs that block usage

---

## Day 2 - Add Feedback Collection

### Simple Feedback Options (pick one):
- [ ] **Tally.so form** - free, embedded, simple
- [ ] **Google Form** - link in app footer or profile
- [ ] **In-app feedback button** - "Found a bug? Tell us"
- [ ] **Discord server** - real-time chat with testers

### Key Questions to Ask Users:
1. What's your chess rating/experience level?
2. Where did you get confused or stuck?
3. What did you enjoy most?
4. Would you use this regularly? Why/why not?
5. What feature would make this 10x better?

### Add Basic Analytics
- [ ] Add Plausible or Vercel Analytics (privacy-friendly)
- [ ] Track: page views, lesson starts, puzzle completions
- [ ] See where users drop off

---

## Day 3 - Get Testers In

### Places to Share:
- [ ] Chess friends/contacts (direct message)
- [ ] r/chess or r/chessbeginners (be genuine, ask for feedback)
- [ ] Chess Discord servers
- [ ] Twitter/X chess community
- [ ] Local chess club if you have one

### What to Say:
> "I built a chess learning app and I'd love your feedback. Everything is free right now - just looking to improve it. Takes 5 min to try a few puzzles. [LINK]"

---

## Day 4 - Respond to Feedback

- [ ] Review all feedback received
- [ ] Identify top 3 friction points
- [ ] Fix critical bugs same-day if possible
- [ ] Thank every tester personally
- [ ] Note features people ask for most

---

## Day 5 (Friday) - Assess & Plan

### End of Week Review:
- [ ] How many people tried the app?
- [ ] Where did they get stuck?
- [ ] What do they love?
- [ ] What's missing?
- [ ] Is this worth monetizing? What would people pay for?

---

## Stripe & Monetization (Later - After Feedback)

Save this for AFTER you understand:
- What features people actually use
- What they'd pay for
- Whether the core experience works

Stripe setup is quick (1-2 hours) once you know what to charge for.

---

## Quick Deploy Commands

```bash
# If using Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel
vercel

# Or just connect GitHub repo at vercel.com/new
```

---

## Notes
- Full access = more feedback = better product
- 10 engaged testers > 100 visitors who bounce
- Fix what's broken before adding new features
- Personal outreach works better than posting cold
